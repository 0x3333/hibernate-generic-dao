= Introduction =

The framework features a powerful and flexible search functionality. This is used by passing a `Search` object to search methods on general and generic DAOs.

`Search` provides flexible search options:
  * Filtering on properties using standard operators ( =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, LIKE, IN ).
  * Combining individual filters with any combination of logical operators ( AND, OR, NOT ).
  * Sorting on properties.
  * Paging.
  * Defining a search remotely from client code.
  * Transforming search results into objects, lists, arrays and maps
  * Specifying which properties to fetch eagerly.
