#summary How to use the framework in your project.

=Installation=
==Maven==
If your project uses Maven, then simply add the repository and dependency...
{{{
<repository>
        <id>trg-dao-repo</id>
        <name>Repository for The Revere Group's Hibernate Generic DAO framework</name>
        <url>http://hibernate-generic-dao.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/maven-repo/</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
        <groupId>com.trg</groupId>
        <artifactId>trg-dao</artifactId>
        <version>0.4.2</version> <!-- or whatever the latest version is -->
</dependency>
}}}

==Other==
Download the Jars from http://hibernate-generic-dao.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/maven-repo/com/trg/trg-dao/

Select the folder with the version you would like (the latest is generally the best). You only need the binary jar (trg-dao-X.X.X.jar), but you can also get the source jar to
help out your IDE with Javadocs and to help yourself out being able to see what's going
on (trg-dao-X.X.X-sources.jar).

You will also need the Hibernate 3.3 jars and their dependencies. I'll leave you to do all the hibernate configuration.

The project has one other dependency. That is Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J). I think Hibernate 3.3 also requires this to be configured.
