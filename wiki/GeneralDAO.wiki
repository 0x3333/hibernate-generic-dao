#summary The GeneralDAO is a single DAO class that can be used to access all classes of domain objects.

= Introduction =

The GeneralDAO is a single DAO class that can be used to access all classes of domain objects. GeneralDAO has methods that require the developer to specify which type of domain object to use. An application only needs a single instance of the GeneralDAO class to access all domain objects.

= Details =

Here is the Javadoc that describes all the methods available with the GeneralDAO:

http://hibernate-generic-dao.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/source/doc/index.html?com/trg/dao/dao/standard/GeneralDAO.html

Spring configuration:

The classes are annotated with @Resource so that Spring fills in the `sessionFactory` property automatically. Therefore only one line is needed in the spring config XML:
{{{
<bean id="generalDAO" class="com.trg.dao.hibernate.GeneralDAOImpl"/>
}}}
