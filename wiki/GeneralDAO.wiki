#summary The GeneralDAO is a single DAO class that can be used to access all classes of domain objects.

= Introduction =

GeneralDAO has methods that require the developer to specify which type of domain object to use. An application only needs a single instance of the GeneralDAO class to access all domain objects.

= Details =

Spring configuration:
{{{
<bean id="generalDAO" class="com.trg.dao.GeneralDAOImpl">
    <property name="sessionFactory" ref="sessionFactory"/>
</bean>
}}}

We use Spring auto-wire by type. So we simply use the following line and Spring fills in `sessionFactory` automatically:
{{{
<bean id="generalDAO" class="com.trg.dao.GeneralDAOImpl"/>
}}}
