=Custom expressions in fields, filters, sorts=
What will we do about type conversion for filter expressions. For example if long is required but int is passed?

=Security=
It seems that doing queries the way we do, no amount of HQL injection will make it possible to use a search to alter database data.

The only concern is ability to query any table. I think Hibernate may provide a way to restrict table access per user roles. This may be something to look into.
